// Fuzzy Slippers
/*
Your friend is a veterinarian and wants to know how many pet slippers
he needs to knit before Christmas.
Your friend looks after three different species: dogs, cats, and chickens.
He asks, very politely, if you can write him a function that calculates
how many slippers he needs to make and provides you with the subtotal of
each species of animal. Please write a function for your friend that returns
the number of slippers that he will be knitting!

// Amazing Anagrams

Anagrams are words that contain the exact same letters in the same quantity.
Robin challenges you to write a function that accepts two words and returns
true if they are anagrams.
BONUS: write the function so that it can receive any number of words and
returns true if all of them are anagrams of each other.
